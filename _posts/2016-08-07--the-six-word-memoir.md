# ... the six-word memoir

Similar to the shortest story written by Hemingway, the six word memoir distills the essence of the subject more concisely than even the wasteful common tweet.

The only rule is that there can only be six (6) words, but those six words must allow the reader to create a greater story that is personally meaningful, either as insight to the narrative, or as an interpretation based on the reader's own experience and imagination.

Not intended as definition, the six words become inspiration.

Hemingway's famous story?

_"For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn."_

As a memoir, mine might be..

_"Honest, even when he knew better."_
